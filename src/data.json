He bikes, runs, swims, sometimes all in the same day. Together, Kitty and Michael teach Meditation classes with the \"Teaching of Intuitional Metaphysics\" under the guidance of the Masters Babaji, Jesus, and St. Germain.\r\n\r\nThe young adults here are photographers, surfers, artists and/or musicians and budding farmers.\r\nWe are slowly turning this land into a permaculture farm and a center of creativity, learning to live simply, with joy and kindness.\r\n \r\nWe hold a public non-denominational meditation at our house every Sunday night: you are welcome to join us if you are here.\r\n\r\nWe have been hosting on airbnb since July, 2009 and really love what this company has made possible. We have met so many wonderful people from around the world that we would never have met if we hadn't had this opportunity with airbnb! Some of our guests (especially the ones from Europe) have never seen a hummingbird before and here they get to see them up close - just a few feet from them as the birds \"hum\" around the feeders.\r\n\r\nWe welcome you to come experience the peace and tranquility that our wonderful land has to offer.",

I am a single Dad with 2 great kids off to college! I built this home 3 years ago and love living near downtown Nashville. I am an avid walker and most weeks put in 15 to 20 miles just walking from my home to the Historical Germantown area, Bicentennial Mall State Park, Farmers Market, State Capital, Legislative Plaza, TPAC, then on to Lower Broad, 2nd Ave, and Riverfront park where all the honky tonks are located! That total distance is just a little over 2 miles each way. \r\n\r\n     I was in the USAF and Tennessee Air Guard for 13 years where i was a navigator on C-130's. After my military life i became a General Contractor and started my own business. After being in the country for so long i decided to try the city life. I bought a vacant lot in this historical overlay district and loved it. Since then I have built 2 more homes on this street. I do love this up and coming neighborhood. \r\n\r\n     I also love to hike the mountains! I have summed 3 12,000 foot peaks in the Rockies and last summer my son and I summed 14,254 foot Long's Peak in Rocky Mountain National Park. I must admit - it kicked my ass ... but wow!... what a view!  Leaves no doubt there is a God!  I also love to kayak and travel. But the best times are with the kids. We love to play strategy board games..Settlers of Catan, Acquire, and Cashflow. I love Axis and Allies, but its hard to get them to play that! I also play in a Texas holdem Poker League...for points...not for cash!\r\n\r\nUPDATE:  That's my first grandbaby...Walt....Born 19 November 2012!!",

Over the past 15 years I've restored several vintage Airstream trailers and consider them the ultimate in camping comfort. One of my restorations now actually resides in Japan! \r\nWe used to love to travel and camp in our 1957 'FLYING CLOUD' AIRSTREAM but now enjoy allowing others to share the experience without the hassle of driving, towing and fighting for a spot in a crowded and noisy campground. We live on a 40+ acre ranch property (with some overly friendly dogs and horses) in the Santa Monica Mountains- surrounded by thousands of acres of open space and direct access to the famous Backbone Trail, which is renowned for hiking, horseback and mountain bike riding. We are also only 6 miles from the glorious beaches of Malibu. Our hilltop location is the perfect deluxe camping experience, with ocean views, and base to enjoy this unique mountain range and Mediterranean climate which occurs in only 6 places in the world.",

        "host_about": "I know your not coming to Nashville to visit me, but i will do my best to provide a great place to stay while you are in Nashville! I am a single Dad with 2 great kids off to college! I built this home 3 years ago and love living near downtown Nashville. I am an avid walker and most weeks put in 15 to 20 miles just walking from my home to the Historical Germantown area, Bicentennial Mall State Park, Farmers Market, State Capital, Legislative Plaza, TPAC, then on to Lower Broad, 2nd Ave, and Riverfront park where all the honky tonks are located! That total distance is just a little over 2 miles each way. \r\n\r\n     I was in the USAF and Tennessee Air Guard for 13 years where i was a navigator on C-130's. After my military life i became a General Contractor and started my own business. After being in the country for so long i decided to try the city life. I bought a vacant lot in this historical overlay district and loved it. Since then I have built 2 more homes on this street. I do love this up and coming neighborhood. \r\n\r\n     I also love to hike the mountains! I have summed 3 12,000 foot peaks in the Rockies and last summer my son and I summed 14,254 foot Long's Peak in Rocky Mountain National Park. I must admit - it kicked my ass ... but wow!... what a view!  Leaves no doubt there is a God!  I also love to kayak and travel. But the best times are with the kids. We love to play strategy board games..Settlers of Catan, Acquire, and Cashflow. I love Axis and Allies, but its hard to get them to play that! I also play in a Texas holdem Poker League...for points...not for cash!\r\n\r\nUPDATE:  That's my first grandbaby...Walt....Born 19 November 2012!!",
